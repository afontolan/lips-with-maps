# LIPS WITH MAPS
LIPS (Learning-based Indoor Positioning System) with Maps

This is a research project for indoor GPS. It is an extension of [LIPS](https://github.com/davidmascharka/LIPS), 
originally developed by [David Mascharka](https://github.com/davidmascharka), where we are including maps instead of a blank slate for showing the location of the user.

## Using source code with Android Studio
1. Clone this project.

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/maheshgaya/lips-with-maps.git
  ```
2. Import the project directory in Android Studio, do File -> New -> Import Project.
3. Create an xml file `app/src/main/res/values/google_maps_api_key.xml` for adding the Google Maps API key. Add the code below and replace `GOOGLE MAPS KEY` with your own key from the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). The key requires Google Maps API for Android and Google Places API for Android

  ```
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <resources>
      <!-- enter your key -->
      <string name="google_maps_key">GOOGLE MAPS KEY</string>
  </resources>
  ```
4. Run the project on an emulator or on your Android phone. (API >= 16)
